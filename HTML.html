	   <p> Html stands for <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>.It is used for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. Html had its very early beginning in 1989 when physicist Tim Berners-Lee proposed the idea to CERN researchers to share documents using html. In late 1990 Tim specified that html woud wright the browser and software of the server. That year Tim and Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding but did not officially get funding. But of course eventually they got funding to continue their work. Html is extremely important because it is literally the skeleton of websites and without it there would be no order to them.

	    <h2>Now on to the CSS section</h2>
	    
	      <p>  CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets. </strong>It used for describing the look and formatting of the document written in a markup language. On October 10, 1994 CSS was first proposed by Hakum Wium Lie as another style sheet. Yet at the same time he was working with Tim Berners Lee on Html and many other style sheet languages were also being proposed. In 1996, CSS1 was released due to the discussions of public mailing lists inside W3C. Hakum Wium Lie along with Bert Bos officially wrote the CSS. CSS is also very important because it gives the html/webpage a lot of detail and makes look more presentable. Without CSS all webpages would be boring and colorless and nobody wants that.

	    <h2>Now lets get on to Tags.</h2>
	    <p> Tags are commands for organizing and categorizing sections of websites on the Html for those websites. Some examples of tags are...	       
	       <ul>
	       <li>the ul tag which creates an unordered(bulleted) list</li> 
	       <li>there is the ol tag which creates an ordered(numbered) list</li>
	       <li>there is the br tag which creates a line break so there is space between sertan parts of the page</li> 
	       <li>there is also the p tag which creates a paragraph.</li>
	   </ul>
	  
	   <h2>Now lets learn about Attributes</h2>
	   <p>Attributes are used as labels to help categorize in the Html and the attributes will be used as selectors in CSS section. To change an attribute one would have to delete the old attribute and type in a new one.Some examples of attributes are the id attribute which in the CSS is represented by '#' then the words that follow and the class attribute which in the CSS is represented by '.' again the words that follow.</p>
